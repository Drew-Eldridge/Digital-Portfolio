	    <h2>Experience:</h2>
	    <p>I volunteer at many volunteering opportunies, involving band activities such as middle school all region; Merlin Maven Mentors, where I mentor students in Computer Science; Allen Community Outreach, where I stock shelves for the food pantry or I unload shipments for donations; and many other numerous volunteering opportunities. I also work at the restaurant Uncle Julio's as a host and have been working there for a couple months. This job helps me improve my communication skills as I have to work in a team and also interact with every customer that walks in the building.</p>

	    <h2>Family</h2>
	    <p>I live with both my mom and dad as well as two dogs, Tootsie and Levi. I have a 21 year old brother but he lives with friends, though he lives close so I still see him a lot.</p>

	    <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
	    <p>I love to collect vinyls, and just listen to music in general. I love to play video games but my favorite hobby is just hanging out with friends. I love to read manga and watch anime as well as play instruments such as both electric and acoustic guitar, ukulele, euphonium, baritone, bugle, and many other random instruments. I love to play sports but at the same time there is nothing I love more than to stay inside, just depends on my mood.</p>

	    <h2>Activities:</h2>
	    <p>The activity that fills up most of my time is band. I play the Euphonium in band and that is where I meet and see a lot if not most of my friends. I am in National Honor Society, Tri-M Music Honor Society, Merlin Maven Mentors, and an officer in cultural art club. I participate in other school activities such as pb&joy among others.</p>

	    <h2>Plan for the Future:</h2>
	    <p>My plans for my future are relatively unclear since I dont exactly know what colleges I will get into out of the ones that I want to apply to as well as I'm still unsure of my exact major once I get in. The top colleges on my list are UC Berkeley, Duke, Cal Tech, and Rice. The majors I am considering is computer science, computer engineering, or another type of engineering with computer science as a minor. For now I just want to have as much fun in highschool while I'm still here but still study hard.</p>
