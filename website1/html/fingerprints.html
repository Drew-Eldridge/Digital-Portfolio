	  1.What are the two primary purposes of a secure, HTTPS connection?
	  known as SSL or TSL, authenticates the identity of the server and binds a key to the server
	  
	  2.What is an HTTPS Proxy Appliance?
	  these circumvent the gurantee of privacy and security on the internet since it establishes a proxy over the HTTPS/SSL
	  
	  3.What is MITM?  What risks does this present?
	  man in the middle attack, genereal term for when a perpetrator places himself in between the server and the application for personal benefits, which makes it look like it is occuring normally. goal is to steal info and thats the risk is that they steal personal info like bank info
	  
	  4.What is a hash? What are the essential qualities that make a hash a "good" hash?
	  a hash is any function that turns a given key or a string of characters into another value, normally represented by a shorter value. a good hash always uses a one way hashing algorithm, the hash value is determines solely from the data being hashed, it uses all hte input data, and it uniformly distrubites the data across the entire set of possible hash values.
	  
	  5.What is a CA? What role do they play?
	  A CA is the certificate authorities which is who websites try to prove their identity with using incorportation documentation. they digitially sign a sites certificate which establishes its certainty in its identity. 
	  
	  6.How can SSL interception be prevented?
	  It cannot be prevented
	  
	  7.How can SSL interception be detected?
	  Utilizing a type of hash called a cryptographic hash which creates a key called a fingerprint of a website which CANNOT be replicated unless they are the private server, so no SSL intercepting proxy alliance can hide the fact that it is intercepting information since the public key WILL be different. 
	  
	  8.What is a false-positive? What is a false-negative?
	  a false positive is where if checking a wesbite which utilizes many different serverse and sites, they utilize multiple certificates but the same security certificate may not be obtained leading to users thinkng that their inforation is being intercepted when it could not be.
	  A false negative is where since when an SSL interception is occuring the content cannot be trusted, so theoretically an advanced SSL interception proxy COULD alter the fingerprint that is being displayed the to the one that they are providing.
	  
	  9.Does your school / government / ISP have a right to eavesdrop on your communications?
	  Yes. since they provide the connection they maintain the right to intercept our communcation. 
	  
	  10.Include a detailed flowchart describing an algorithm to compare an authentic fingerprint with another retrieved from a browser.
