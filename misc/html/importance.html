      <p>This portfolio can and does mean a lot to me. It represents an immense amount of hard work that I have put in not only towards Computer Science I, II, and III, but also in other classes and many other areas that help contribute to this work. This portfolio can help show off all of my projects and accomplishments for others to see which is just such a cool concept. This can help me get into college, get into future occupations, or just show off to friends, family, and acquantances about my accomplishments. This will not only allow me to showcase my ability to build my own website but also all of my major projects in many different classes. It is overall an expression of myself through coding and my projects which is very cool and something I can show off to not only my friends but also my employers as I navigate through the professional world. <p>
