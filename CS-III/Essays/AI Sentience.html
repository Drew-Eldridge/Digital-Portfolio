	<p>Technology is an ever expanding aspect of everyones lives in todays society, and one of the more pressing topics and places of expansion is AI. AI or Artificial Intelligence is the development of computer systems which are able to preform human tasks such as seeing, talking, comprehending, and even just moving on its own. As AI develop and become more and more sentient, the question arises of if they will be overall detrimental or beneficial to society. Movies such as “Terminator” or “I, Robot”, or just media in general love to paint sentient AI as extremely detrimental and this is both correct and false. Sentient AI is beneficial but also can lead to extremely dangerous scenarios, as well as how much of life they will take away from humans for better or for worse. </p>
	  <p>
	    The first question to be asked is can AI become truly sentient and what does that mean. The AI professional world highly differs in their opinions on this topic. Some researchers claim the other side is living in science fiction when they think that AI can be sentient while the other side claims that they need to wake up to the reality of AI. It is a highly debated topic that truly has no answer because sentience has no true definition. It is the ability to feel and see something and exist in a state of matter, but wouldn’t that make a camera sentient? There are many questions to be answered regarding AI sentience which no one truly has an answer for. Some scientists such as Blake Lemoine, an AI researcher formally working for Google, claimed that their large scale language model AI was sentient because it talked like a human. Google themselves and many other scientists dismissed him as crazy and living in the future not the now, but this event highlights just how real the possibility is to many peoples definitions of sentient beings. </p>

	    AI can be beneficial in countless ways, proving services, completing mundane labor and tasks, organizing information, and the list goes on. Inside of the medical industry, AI is already being used for some things but can lead to infinite possibilities. AI would be able to provide diagnosis', which could free up countless healthcare individuals that would spend their time doing so, when they could work with people that need it the most. It would also save healthcare businesses and the public money since the AI app would most certainly be cheaper than spending the healthcare individuals time and spending the money to pay for their time (Kristina, 2021). AI for now are helping humanity have lots of perks to life that make life go faster. Auto fill passwords, autofill searches, target based advertising, etc. AI has even been shown to drive cars, ships, drones, and planes, which can make travel infinitely safer and more efficient through the use of AI. AI also has countless possibilities with education. Websites such as khan academy are starting to utilize it to an extent, but if developed the possibilities are endless. AI could tailor education specifically to the student to allow for maximum learning (Kristina, 2021). Much like with healthcare, AI would be able to relieve teachers and their time as it would reduce the amount of time that teachers would need to spend trying to personally help students, if the AI did it for them. AI such as Github's, github copilot writes code for the user, or the AI, Dall-e, is able to input any string of words in the english language and be able to generate an AI photo to the best of its ability to the statement input; AI is being used to organize numerous information, impossible for humans to track such as weather forecasts or to predict earthquakes (Metz, 2022). While all of these have faults and are no where near perfect, if constantly developed then the possibilities in the future are almost endless. </p>

	    AI can be harmful in an equally numerous list of ways such as taking away jobs, but AI’s harmful nature is mostly speculative at this point in time as AI has not progressed enough to truly replace humans in much of anything. If someone would go off of the assumption that AI will continue to progress at an alarming rate, then it presents numerous issues that could harm society. The most pressing issue is of how it could eliminate jobs. If AI were able to progress, then the labor migration that would ensue would put all previous labor migrations to shame. AI would eliminate most if not all of factory jobs, all monotonous jobs that require robotic sorts of labor will cease to exist with the addition of AI to the workforce. According to the PWC 7 million jobs will be replaced by AI by 2037 inside of the UK (Marr, 2021). If AI can eliminate monotonous labor can they also have original thought? Original thoughts and creativity is the thing that AI are still beaten by humans in, but AI could learn to develop these. If AI utilize machine learning, an algorithm where they utilize historical data to predict outcomes and possibilities for actions, original thought is most likely impossible because everything they think will come from something else. But if scientists can get around this hurdle then humans are in trouble. STiTCH, an AI developed by Urbancoolab utilized machine learning to create a unique fashion line for Urbancoolab (Urbancool, 2022). This spells trouble for fashion desigers, an industry that would be safe from AI influence if AI cannot overcome original thought. Stephen Thaler invented an AI named DABUS which in the UK came up with multiple patents for drink containers that could be used during first responder scenarios, but was rejected by courts since AI legally cannot own patents (Wadie 2021). This could also spell issues if AI do develop further, if they deserve rights or not will surely be a huge debate in society. AI in todays society are also terrible at ethics since they will follow the legal option, or the option that they are programmed to commit. This ethics issues can lead to disagreements and problems if for example an AI was driving a car, which would have other peoples lives at stake. AI also contributes to targeted advertisement, which big tech companies implement by spying on what people search and interact with on the internet then using AI they create advertisements which would perfectly match what they are needing. If AI continue to advance these advertisements would continue to become more and more targeted. While this may seem like a positive, it brings the issue of privacy into question because of just how much the AI would know about people. These AI would have all information about basically every person which could have catastrophic consequences if fallen into the wrong hands. All of these issues and possibilities lead to countless negative side effects of AI, without even considering the doomsday effect that AI could have on the world if they became truly sentient.

	  <p>
	    All in all AI has numerous benefits and numerous ways that they can harm society, the only question of which one they WILL be when they progress is up to humanity for how fast they can adapt to AI changing the world around them. For every positive possibility that AI can bring to the world, there is an equal and opposite negative possibility that could be cast upon the world. The good news is is that the negative side effects are mostly if not all speculative while the positive implications have real world evidence to back them up. AI will become one of the biggest facets of society very soon, so the only thing that humanity can do is hope that if they are sentient they are kind to their creators.
