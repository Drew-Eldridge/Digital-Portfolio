	    <p>In today's society, everyone is constantly belittled by decisions. Inherently in almost every decision made by every person, there will be a bias because of a person’s mindset, upbringing, lack or misunderstanding of information, prejudice, intelligence, and countless other factors that influence every single decision. There are countless types of biases, such as confirmation bias, where you look for “information that supports your existing beliefs,” or Gamblers bias, where “you expect past events to influence the future” (mindtools). Another major decision bias is binary thinking, in which you set your mind to only two possible outcomes, a 0 or a 1, which limits creative thinking and can be detrimental to products and life. Inside our ISP, a product that will shut off the user's screen when it detects another set of eyeballs, is a product that cannot escape decision bias.
	</p>
	<p>
	  With a product, something that people can spend countless hours of time and effort to produce, it can be easy to be swept up in overconfidence for how amazing your product is. This is known as overconfidence bias. Overconfidence bias is when “people are overly confident in their intelligence, experience or opinions,” which can be very prevalent in our ISP (timelyapp). This can affect us because we can be swept up in how amazing our product seems to us because it means something to us, and become overconfident, inflicting a bias on our business decisions like being too risky. We can overcome this by always taking a step back during our process and reflect on our product's true worth and potential instead of an overconfident view of them.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Gathering information for a product can be arduous, especially when faced with information that contradicts or goes against the product. Confirmation bias is when you “only listen to or respect the data that aligns with [your] own viewpoints” (timelyapp). This can affect our ISP because if, for example, we were faced with information that said that people feel no need for increased security on their computers (which is highly unlikely), then if we choose to ignore this issue instead of addressing it, it would lead to confirmation bias. We can overcome this bias by reading both arguments for and against our product and making our product addressing both sides.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Creating something yourself can lead to an increase in hubris concerning the project. This is the IKEA bias, in which people “put excessively higher value on jobs or projects that we’ve been part of” (timelyapp). This can lead to discounting others ideas because you have too much bias in your own product. This can affect our ISP if, for example, one of us has an idea, the other could disagree with the other since we did not come up with it ourselves. This hubris could come in the way of our product, but we can overcome it by keeping an open mind to the other person’s ideas, or ideas that we find elsewhere.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Challenges inside of product development are difficult to overcome and often it is easier to blame others for the issues. Fundamental attribution error is this “tendency to blame others when things go wrong, instead of looking objectively at the situation,” leading to increased discord among members (mindtools). This can deeply affect our ISP because it could cause disagreements between our group if one person blames another for all of our problems. We must counteract this by having empathy and understanding the other person’s point of view in the situation, to counteract this personal bias.
	</p>
	<p>
	  First impressions are often regarded as incredibly important for relationships between people, but the first information you learn about a topic is equally important towards your total understanding in that topic. This “tendency to heavily rely or anchor on the first piece of information you learn” is known as anchoring bias and can heavily impact our ISP (Murphy). If in our ISP, one of us finds out about a camera that could work for our eye tracking in the beginning of the project, then the other person, later on, says that they found a better camera, if the first person has this bias it could lead to disagreements or a worsening of the project. This bias leads to an inability to adapt to change, one of the most important skills regarding product development. We can counteract this by staying open to change and always having an ear open to the other person’s ideas that could change the project.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Binary decision-making is another huge issue that we could face in our project. If in our project we narrow down decisions to just two options or binary, it could lead to a worsening project because of the inability to keep an open mind. For example, if we narrow down the type of camera we can use to just two options, we are limiting countless other amazing possibilities that could be way better for our project. Also, if we narrow certain parts of code into just binary options of possible ways to do it, it could worsen our code. We must counteract binary decision-making but never close off our options. We must also keep it narrow enough for our decisions not to become impossible with an ever-increasing number of options.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Personal bias is inescapable, especially in product development, and something we must accept will happen during our ISP, but that does not mean we can not try to fend it off. Most of bias leads to negative impacts on our product, but it can also be avoided mostly if we keep an open mind for all information and ideas. We must stay self-aware in all decisions that we make to try to eliminate bias as much as we can.
