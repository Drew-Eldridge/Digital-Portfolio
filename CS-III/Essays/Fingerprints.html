	  1.What are the two primary purposes of a secure, HTTPS connection? DONE
	  known as SSL or TSL, authenticates the identity of the server and binds a key to the server
	  
	  2.What is an HTTPS Proxy Appliance? DONE
	  these circumvent the gurantee of privacy and security on the internet since it establishes a proxy over the HTTPS/SSL
	  
	  3.What is MITM?  What risks does this present? DONE
	  man in the middle attack, genereal term for when a perpetrator places himself in between the server and the application for personal benefits, which makes it look like it is occuring normally. goal is to steal info and thats the risk is that they steal personal info like bank info
	  
	  4.What is a hash? What are the essential qualities that make a hash a "good" hash? DONE
	  a hash is any function that turns a given key or a string of characters into another value, normally represented by a shorter value. a good hash always uses a one way hashing algorithm, the hash value is determines solely from the data being hashed, it uses all hte input data, and it uniformly distrubites the data across the entire set of possible hash values.
	  
	  5.What is a CA? What role do they play? DONE 
	  A CA is the certificate authorities which is who websites try to prove their identity with using incorportation documentation. they digitially sign a sites certificate which establishes its certainty in its identity. 
	  
	  6.How can SSL interception be prevented? DONE
	  It cannot be prevented
	  
	  7.How can SSL interception be detected? DONE
	  Utilizing a type of hash called a cryptographic hash which creates a key called a fingerprint of a website which CANNOT be replicated unless they are the private server, so no SSL intercepting proxy alliance can hide the fact that it is intercepting information since the public key WILL be different. 
	  
	  8.What is a false-positive? What is a false-negative? DONE
	  a false positive is where if checking a wesbite which utilizes many different serverse and sites, they utilize multiple certificates but the same security certificate may not be obtained leading to users thinkng that their inforation is being intercepted when it could not be.
	  A false negative is where since when an SSL interception is occuring the content cannot be trusted, so theoretically an advanced SSL interception proxy COULD alter the fingerprint that is being displayed the to the one that they are providing.
	  
	  9.Does your school / government / ISP have a right to eavesdrop on your communications?
	  Yes. since they provide the connection they maintain the right to intercept our communcation. 
	  
	  10.Include a detailed flowchart describing an algorithm to compare an authentic fingerprint with another retrieved from a browser.

	  The internet is a place that is filled with seemingly limitless information and websites to browse. This limitless potential for user interactions leads to many risks and dangers, the main one being privacy. Nothing on the internet is private to only one person. Someone somewhere can see what information is being entered or what sites someone is browsing. There are ways however to prevent malicious people and people that should not be spying on someone from getting this information, or at least just letting the user know that they are being watched. </p>
	<p>
	  Websites can utilize different types of connections such as HTTP or HTTPS. Since HTTPS, otherwise known as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) is more secure, in the earlier days of the internet most websites only used them in situations when sensitive information such as logins or bank information is being used. The two primary purposes of a secure HTTPS connection is to provide encryption for the exchange between the server and the client, and to bind a key to that serer. HTTPS connections are time consuming and difficult to set up which is why many websites avoided using them for the whole site. Nowadays as technology has grown websites have switched to ALL HTTPS to protect themselves more, leading to organizations like the government losing their vision over what users do on the internet, leading to things called HTTPS Proxy Alliances. HTTPS Proxy Alliances are groups that circumvent the gurantee of privacy and security on the internet since it establishes a proxy over the HTTPS which allows the groups to view browsing data. An example of utilization of this is a man in the middle attack, a general name for when an attacker places themselves between the server and the application to view browsing data or pesonal information. This can be dangerous as they can steal valuable information such as logins or bank information.

	<p>SSL interception is something that cannot be prevented but it can be detected. CA otherwise known as Certificate Authorities is an entity to which websites prove their identity to in the physical world using incoporation documentation. They play the role as basically the authorities which prove whether a website is malicious or not, sort of a safeguard for the internet. When a website has sufficiently proven its identity the CA will digitally sign a security certificate for the website which is an assertion of the websites identity. A hash is any function that turns a given key or a string of values into another value or a key. A good hash must have a one way hashing algorithm, where it cannot be reveresed back into the given information or it is extremely difficult to do so; the value/key is deteremined solely from the data being hashed; it uses all of the input data; and it uniformly distrubtes the data across the entire set of hash values. A type of hash is used to detect if there is SSL interception, the type of hash being a cryptographic hash. This type of hash creates a key called a fingerprint from the SSL certificate for the website, and this key CANNOT be reversed or replicated unless done by the private server. Utilizing key checking algorithms the website can check if the key provided matches up with the key that would normally be produced. If these do not match then it will detect that someone is SSL interception the persons data. There are risks with this method though since there can be false-positives and false-negatives. A false-positive is where if when checking a website which utilizes many different servers and sites, normally bigger corporations websites such as Amazon, they utilize many different security certificates and thus when the website sends a valid certificate, it could not match the one on the page since it can be any of the valid certificates. A false-negative are mostly theoretical scenarios but are still incredibly possible. This can happen if a proxy alliance is only monitering certain cites, leading users to believe since their fingerprints match on one page, they are led to believe that no other connections are intercepted. Also once SSL interception has happened, the information can be tampered with and making it so the authentic fingerprint could be replaced and the new fake one forwarded to match with the fraudulent fingerprints, leading to a false belief that SSL interception is NOT occuring. 
	  </p>
	<p>
	  All in all, SSL interception is a major problem that invades on the privacy of millions if not billions of internet users everyday from a multitude of sources, most commonly their internet service providers, the government, and establishments like schools. These groups have a right to eavesdrop on the communication of its users because they provide for the internet and control it, such as with the internet service providers and schools, and the government reserves the right due to the right to request records. This issue cannot be prevented but it can be detected through a multitude of ways if the user is proficient at identifying them.
