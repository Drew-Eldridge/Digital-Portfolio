	    <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	    <p> I furthered my knowledge in qml but still lacked in a lot of areas which led to many technical challenges such as not knowing how to make images transparent, not knowing how to use buttons, not knowing a lot of members inside of many different handlers and classes. I have to learn so much as I go about qml and I have barely made anything so far to show for it. I also encountered the issues of installing eye tracking software on my mac instead of windows which had many challenges. 
	    </p>
	    <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	    <p>
	      Our group was able to work on the project more this week because of less work from other classes. Some days especially in class we were not able to work on the project as much because of other computer science projects such as Lindenmayer systems and other missions. We also encountered the same issue of github commits since they are all on the same files which leads to scheduling conflicts since merging is a real hassle, so working at the same time is tricky and sorta unreliable.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	    <p>
	      We did not really have any disagreements or challenges between us this week, just that sometimes one person could work while the other couldn't and visa versa which led to challenges between us of splitting up the workload. We are good at making decisions that both of us like so splitting up the work, when done successful has been extremely productive since we both value and accept the others opinions since often the others opinion seems like the better one.

	    <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	    <p>
	      I encountered the challenges of not knowing how to use qml. I have to learn how to code what I am doing while also diagnose issues for a language I've never used before. It was incredibly challenging but I have been getting a lot better. I did not know how to really move buttons, use backgrounds, popups, really anything. Everything I did really challenged me.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	    <p>
	      We could not work on the project that much together, though we were able to more than previously. He would be busy with CSII and I would be busy with CSIII or other classes. Once we were able to work on the project at the same time, we ran into the issue of git merging because most if not all of our work is contained inside of one file. This caused a lot of challenges since quickly pushing and working is a hassle.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	    <p>
	      Like I said before we encountered the issues of git merging because of us working on the same file at the same time. Our communication was limited and less what it should be which led to us accomplishing more than what the other person knew, leading to many surprises. We need to communicate more about what we want to complete and what we are going to complete.

	    <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	    <p>
	      We encountered countless technical challenges, mostly with downloading the appropriate software to attempt to research for this project. My mac computer was giving me a lot of trouble and causing challenges. Such as how it predownloads python 2.7.1 instead of python3 which led to a lot of code not working. We also encountered the issue of not being able to figure out how to change tabs, the thing we wanted to do.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	    <p>
	      We were not able to work on the ISP nearly as much as we would have wanted because of things like the SQL test and countless other assignments that we have from other classes. This led to a largely unproductive week for our ISP. We were still able to communicate with eachother about how we wanted to accomplish the project, and still researched, so it is not like we did nothing but still. 
	    </p>
	    <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	    <p>
	      We did not really have any interpersonal challenges except for the fact that sometimes our workloads would conflict since we are different grade and comp sci levels. So I couldve had work when he didnt and he could've had work when I didn't. It led to challenges being able to work on it together for extended periods of time or really at all.

	    <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	    <p>
	    We encountered technical challenges such as us not being able to view the open source code for eye tracking and eye detection. We were not able to copy the code inside of our git repository for studying but we have researched many different eye trackers. 
	    </p>
	    <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	    <p>
	    Our team was not really able to work on it that much outside of school because of scheduling conflicts such as band, or other classwork that interferes with computer science. We overall did not have a lot of time to work on the project outside of school because of these scheduling conflicts. 
	    </p>
	    <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	    <p>
	    We were not able to work together at the same time all that much if at all. This resulted in some challenges with knowing what we wanted because we were not working at the same time on this.

	    <h2>9-Jan-2023</h2>
	    <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	    <p>
	      We encountered countless technical challenges, namely because of us operating on a school computer and especially on a mac. Because of these characteristics we were not able to download and properly test most if not all of the code that we wished to and we have to research them at home now. I encountered the issue of not being able to even read the websites that I wished to read because of how many websites the school has blocked on the school computers. It's incredibly frustrating to be stopped at every turn as you try to just work on the project that you're working on.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	    <p>
	      We encountered a couple scheduling challenges. We were struggling with how we could not download our programs on our school mac computers which pushed scheduling to our at home time. This leads to numerous scheduling conflicts because we cant research while we're in school. At least not in the programs that we want. some more scheduling conflicts is just other schoolwork that could impede our ISP work at home which leads to conflicts.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	    <p>
	      We did not encounter many if any interpersonal challenges this week because we are just starting out and gaining the reigns of our project. We have collaborated in a lot of things that we do but also have split the work on different things which could cause a challenge if one of us makes a decision without the others consent that they dont like. But that has not occured yet so we will have to see.

	<h3>
	  (Software) Development Engineer
	</h3>
	<p>
	  Development engineers design the product and improve the product to the specifications that the team requires. I have good suitability for this role because I an excited to work projects, especially ones that are fun like this one. I love to be able to see my progress on a project and see myself improve as time goes on. I know how to code well and strive for perfection even though thats impossible which I think people in this role need. I will encounter the challenge of not knowing how to do a lot of things especially in this project which is so foreign for me. I will have to learn and that will be challenging, especially for the topics that our product dives into.
	</p>
	<h3>
	  QA Engineer
	</h3>
	<p>
	  QA or quality assurance engineers create tests which identify issues with the product so that the product can strive for perfection. This role tries to break the product so that it will be better in the long run. I think I am suitable for this role because I do strive for perfection and that is the point of this role. I also am familiar with having to break items as a previously destructive child so I think I could come up with creative issues that our product would have to deal with. There are issues with this role though since it is challenging to come up with issues for your product without seperating yourself from the product. It is hard to ruin a product that you spend so much time on so that would be challenging. 
	</p>
	<h3>
	  Project Manager
	</h3>
	<p>
	  This is the person overall in charge of the project and the execution of that project. This person makes the goals of the project into a reality. I have good suitability for this role because I think that I am good at executing plans inside of projects especially ones I am passionate about. I am great at problem solving and this role is problem solving the entire project. This role is equally rewarding as it is challenging. It's challenging because of how you must lead a team on a project that depends on you. You must come up with solutions to countless projects and is the person that must guide the project as it goes along.
	</p>
	<h3>
	  Product Manager
	</h3>
	<p>
	  This role establishes the goals and lifecycle of the product to guide the project as it goes along. This person is in charge of the project and the timeline. I was the product manager of the model scheduler last year so I am suitable for this role. I am good at envisioning the project as it goes along so I think that I would be good at this role for our ISP. This role is also extremely challenging as you must lead the people and the project for how you envision it and also get the project out on time. If the project is late it is your fault, and all the faults of the project will fall onto you. 
	</p>
	<h3>
	  Release Manager
	</h3>
	<p>
	  This person is responsible for scheduling planning and controlling the delivery of the software of a project. This person in our ISP will control the Github repository of the project and control the release of the project. I dont think I am that suitable for this role but I think I could still do it. I am adequate in Github but not amazing so it would require a lot of outside learning on my part to control the project. This role is challenging because the whole project is in your hands in how people work on it, what they work on, and what version you will release. There is a lot to do and a lot to think about with this role.
