    <p>Last year in computer science II I learned many things. The main skills I learned, cultivated, and will continue to use were CSS, HTML, and Javascript. Throughout the year I also learned other skills such as basic web development, basic web design, how to use classes, how to use recursion, how to better apply functions, how to work in a team for computer science, and how to lead a team for computer science. There were countless skills that I learned in computer science and all of them will help me later on in life regardless of what I choose to do for a career because of the many applications that a lot of the skills have such as the communication I had to cultivate while working in a team. </p>
