	  <h2>Concept:</h2>
	  <p>The application will be a website/interactive program that will allow users to learn how programs are run by CPUs as well how CPUs work on a basic level. It uses a deconstructed 8-bit CPU so users can see all the parts working. It includes a guide for how CPUs work, an interactive page to input programs, a page to view the CPU executing programs via an embeded youtube livestream, and an FAQ page.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="insideBox" style="width:49%">
	  <h2>Motivation:</h2>
	  <p>Our motivations for this website was that we wanted more people to learn about CPUs and more specifically 8-bit CPUs. We viewed it as something that could be very important for some people to learn if they are going into computers at all, as well as we felt we were targeting a niche since it is not a broadly known topic. Lastly we found it exciting to watch the programs play out right before your eyes.

	  <h2>Code Segments and Explanations:</h2>

	      We utilized custom classes for storing each of our programs. Each instruction inputed is comprised of an address, an instruction, and a value as shown in the class instruction(). Each program is comprised of an id, and an array of sixteen instructions as shown in the class program(). The class programEncoder() converts the JSON.

	    <p style="float:left;width:50%;width:25%">
	      The three arrays programs, ids, currentIDs all store data. Programs keeps an array of all programs yet to be executed, ids keeps a list of all IDs whos programs are yet to be executed which correlates to their location in queue, and currentID is the next ID to be assigned. The function processInputVal converts a blank value input to 0000 so it runs without error. The function processInputInstruct converts a blank value input to NOP so it runs without error.

	      This bit of HTML allows us to not have to retype our code which is on every page such as the navbar, which allows us to save a lot of time and brain power by just having it carry over and extend from another file instead of copying it for every page.

	  <h2>Conclusions:</h2>
	  <p>I loved the product from this project as well as the journey that led us to complete it. This project was equally educational in topics revolving around computer science, like HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but also just as importantly, topics revolving around our project like 8-bit CPUs. This project was extremely interesting to me and also extremely fun because I got to work on it with some great and intelligent friends that really helped out. Overall this project was immensely fun and I'd love to dive more into the topic of 8-bit CPUs later on in life. <br> <br>Group pictured on right, in order, Cooper, Sean, Me
